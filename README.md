## 👋 Hi there, I'm Witten Pan!

I'm a Computer Science & Engineering student at The Ohio State University, passionate about software engineering, machine learning, and solving real-world problems with code. I am currently interning at Sandia National Labs training Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to learn nonstationary solutions to PDEs. Besides that, I am also a software developer at MobilePantry, a startup backed by The Ohio State University.
